          <p>In this society, people are more likely to use e-commerce to buy and sell products instead of shopping in store. E- commerce offers an efficient way for individuals, they do not need to go outside to get their desired product, click on the mobile and the parcel would deliver to the address. The way of shopping online is convenient and time saving, it helps users improve life quality in some way. Based on the research and evaluation, loss of parcel is our main problem to solve. There are various reasons lead to loss of the parcel. First and the most frequently happening case is sending to a wrong destination. As drop and go is quite common in Australia, if the parcel is dropped at a wrong place, everyone is going to ignore it. As a result, the original recipient can hardly track or even get the parcel. The number of transitions is another reason contributes to the loss of item. Based on an estimation, more than 80% of operation is done manually. Those operations include receiving, put away, storage, picking, and shipping (Dewa, Pujawan & Vanany, 2017). Various human errors happened in warehousing operations give rise to picking the wrong item or losing the item. Precisely, the more station the parcels go through, the higher possibility they get lost, vice versa.</p>

        <p>3. The user thinks the interface is clear and can have a button back to the home page.</p>
        <p>4. There can be a home page listing all the features</p>

          <p>This is the second iteration for AutoV. Based on the user evaluation, key findings include typography, flow, function, layout. First, Attendances mentioned the contrast between fonts and background is not enough. We ,therefore, re-correct the color of textbox in order to emphasize the fonts. Next, we did some changes on layout according to what participants revealed. For example, in the “choose you parcel “ page, we altered the distance between each options which made the layout more understandable. Besides, we united the fonts into Montserrat because it has been being the first place in the ranking of “most frequently used font” in UI design. Extracted from our interview, font size is one of the problems. So we altered the fonts size as well. Second, in our refining, we didn’t altered much on the flow, we just change the title name from “ order a drone” to “start delivery”. As former is confusing that participants thought they could buy a drone through our apps. Last, participants mentioned the bar menu is a repeated function and can be removed. So we abandoned the switching function in bar menu and only kept one home button on it.</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>Throughout the semester, I had collaborate with excellent team members that enabled the development of a significant concept – Delivery service app. In this society, people are more likely to use e-commerce to buy and sell products instead of shopping in store, and because of the rise in delivery industry, there are many problems come out. Hence, our design team have carried out user research which focus on receivers in delivery service. Through the user research, we gathered useful information from users and find user insights and needs through different analysis methods. Next, the ideation stage allowed our group to create several concepts that satisfied three types of target audience. After that, we have developed many interface designs through hand sketches, digital wireframe and digital mockups by SKETCH. We then conducted usability test by showing the digital mockup to the users and refinements were made based on their feedbacks. In conclusions, the final prototype improved the efficiency of the delivery service.</p>
