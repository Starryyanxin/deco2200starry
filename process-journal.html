          <p>In the first week’s lecture. The lecturer introduced the course and talked about the user interface. 
          The user interface is a visible, audible, tactile, gustatory or olfactory point of contact between the user and the computer. Defined the good and poor user interface design. For the good user interface, usability is essential.</p>
          <h4>Tutorial</h4>
          <p>In the tutorial, we did a sketching exercise and IxD activity. For the studio, we meet our group tutor and the tutor introduced the design brief to us. To solve the design problem, some of the assessment is individual work and some of them are in a group. My group mates are Jace and Jasmine, and we named our group Peppa pig. We filled up a group form together and decided to meet twice every week to work on assessment.</p>

                <p>In the studio class, my group mates and I decided to identify the problem scenario as context for our design project. At first, we did some research on the autonomous vehicle. And we decided to choose the topic as autonomous dog walking machine. Then we discussed the choice with our tutor, and then tutor gave some advice about this idea. Firstly, the idea should solve some problem. Secondly, the autonomous vehicle needs to carry something from a place to another. So, we found that our idea is not that proper, and decided to change to a new idea. After came up with several ideas about the autonomous vehicle, we choose parcel delivery as the problem finally. </p>
                <p>To solve this design problem, our group has to work on six tasks following a user-centered design process. Research, evaluation, process journal documentation, prototyping, video presentation and web-based portfolio. After finalizing the choose problem with groupmates, we decided to do background research about the autonomous vehicle, drone, delivery service individually. </p>

                <h4>Background research (delivery service)</h4>
                <p>I did some background research about delivery service. And found that in this society, people are more likely to use e-commerce to buy and sell products instead of shopping in store. E- commerce offers an efficient way for individuals, they do not need to go outside to get their desired product, click on the mobile and the parcel would deliver to the address. The way of shopping online is convenient and time saving, it helps users improve life quality in some way.   And the rise of e-commerce leads the delivery service company booming around the world. According to Accenture, courier service is going to grow by 9 percent annually. So, staying ahead of the curve is rather important today.</p>

For retailers, it is a more environmentally friendly, cheaper and efficient future. And new technology is a way to attract more customers.</p>

                <h4>Methodological process</h4>
                <p>I used two methods for the background research. Firstly, survey can gather information about the experiences actions and opinions of customers and it is an efficient way to get different responds of a large amount of people. The advantage of the survey is to collect a quantitative data of the users and to have a general understanding of user experience. Another method is interview, it is a qualitative research method to gain a detailed story behind customers experiences through open-ended questions. This method helps designer to have a deep understanding of the user and their frustrations, motivations and needs. And It is effective to follow up and further investigate their response based on survey.</p>
                <h4>Survey data (questionnaire)</h4>
                <p>23 respondents, 14 questions</p>

                <p>After finished the initial research of delivery service. It shows that there is strong need on the improvements in this industry. There are many problems in delivery service currently, such as time consuming, loss of parcel and courier’s performance. The objective in the improvements of this problem scenario should be focused on the decrease in time taken to deliver a parcel, an efficient way to update the real delivery time, improvements with couriers’ training and quality of the parcel delivery.
                For the next step, my group mates and I decided to combine the user researches together and develop an efficient solution to solve the common issue of delivery service. For next week, we will start developing and designing the UI with wireframes and prototypes to improve the user experiences for the users. </p>

                <p>During the studio, my group mates and I discussed our chosen topic for assessment 2. So, the main problem we found in background research is parcel lost. Our group decided to do one storyboard each person, which means every of us need to think about one idea. </p>
                <p>In the studio, we discussed our 3 storyboards with our tutor and found that we misunderstood the meaning of concept. All the storyboards we made are talking about the same idea, it doesn't count 3 different ideas. Finally, we decided to think about ideas together and then we classified them into group by their common characteristics.</p>
                <p>We made a plan during the studio and distributed work together. Basically, each of us need to do one storyboard and the sketch for it, and we planned to finish the storyboard and sketch before this week. </p>
                <p>Previously on assessment 1, our group was focusing on parcel delivery. Based on the research and evaluation, loss of parcel is our main problem to solve. There are various reasons lead to loss of the parcel. First and the most frequently happening case is sending to a wrong destination. As drop and go is quite common in Australia, if the parcel is dropped at a wrong place, everyone is going to ignore it. As a result, the original recipient can hardly track or even get the parcel. The number of transitions is another reason contributes to the loss of item. Based on an estimation, more than 80% of operation is done manually. Those operations include receiving, put away, storage, picking, and shipping (Dewa, Pujawan & Vanany, 2017). Various human errors happened in warehousing operations give rise to picking the wrong item or losing the item. Precisely, the more station the parcels go through, the higher possibility they get lost, vice versa.</p>
               <p>Our three target groups include using between friends, for customer and staff who works in delivery company. My work is to do the storyboard and sketch for the third idea.</p>
              <h4>Parcel distribution (problem context)</h4>
              <p>Based on the research, improper parcel distribution in warehouse is one of the reasons due to parcel lost. This idea is designed for staff working in warehouse. Staff can customize the method to allow the autonomous vehicle to organized parcels appropriately. </p>

                <h4> Lecture and tutorial</h4>
                <p>In this week’s lecture, we learnt about Don Norman’s 6 universal design principles. For our later interaction design, it need to follow the 6 principles.  Visibility, constraints, consistency, feedback, mapping an affordance. </p>
                <p>For the tutorial, we were making and evaluating low fidelity prototypes. We need to do paper prototypes when in the early phase of a project. It is good to refine the concept, and we need to ask users questions after testing.</p>
                <p>The process of prototype is plan and sketch first; determine the task we want to test; sketch each screen; create all layers; rehearse and test the prototype with the project team and run through the usability test with users using paper prototypes.</p>
                <h4>Strength and weakness of proposed concept</h4>
                <p>In the studio, our group discussed our storyboards with our tutor and got some feedback. For the concept I made, the strength includes it can improve the efficiency inside the warehouse; keep the warehouse neat and tidy; stocktaking can be scheduled to prevent the parcel putting at the wrong place; less dependent on labor force; storing and shipping is under the staff control; human error can be reduced and heavy parcel could be shipped easier. In the other hand, weakness are high cost to maintain the quality of vehicle, working time is depend on the battery and if the vehicle stop functioning, the whole delivery process will be affected.</p>

              <h3>WEEK 9</h3>
              <p>During the studio, our group discussed our ideas and evaluation together. We decided to choose one concept as our final idea. Because of our main problem is loss of parcel, and my idea is based on delivery warehouse, compared to the other two ideas, this is not that urgent issue. And for the one Jace did, it is about direct delivery, from the evaluation, we found that not many people use this.
              </p>
              <p>After a series of evaluations, we finally choose Secure Delivery as our to-be-developed concept. There are 2 reasons that made it better than the others. First, the key findings from assessment 1 revealed that the majority of losing parcel was because of the Courier.  It is true that Parcel Distribution and Direct Delivery reduce the risk of parcel loss during the transition between warehouses, but Secure delivery is a direct solution to the problem. Second, it is probably not realistic to apply Direct Delivery when the parcel is traveling a long way. The battery of drones and weather changes becomes a huge problem yet they are engineering problem. Precisely we would like to go for the solution which is most likely to achieve in the coming future. As a result, we chose Secure delivery for further development.</p>
              <p>For the high fidelity digital wireframe, I will do the main page of the user interface and set the format for the UI, Jace will do the “set up” function and Jasmine’s work is “check your order” function.</p>

              </div>        

              <h4>Choice of design</h4>
              <p>We named our app AutoV, which means autonomous vehicle. For the colour, we choose black, white and grey, the most three simple colors. We believe simple is the best and makes users feel fast, efficient and safe. The size font is 14pt, 18pt and 24pt, it is easy for user to read.</p>
              <h4>Final concept evaluation (heuristic summary) </h4>
              <p>This is an usability method for finding usability problems in a user interface design, therefore making the problem addressable and solvable during iteration process. This summary helps preventing product failure.</p>

   
              <h4>Reflection and next step for evaluation report</h4>
              <p>After evaluating the screen-based interfaces with users, it shows that the APP meets the needs of receivers meanwhile helps eliminate the loss of parcel and improve the efficiency of the parcel delivery service. The screen-based interfaces can still be improved in terms of the quality of the user interfaces. For the next step, we are going to do more evaluation on our chosen concept. It is need more researches and improvement for a better development. Based on the evaluation of our chosen concept. We will focus on working with interact interface. In the next assignment, we will use the knowledge we have learned in the class, make more changes on the interface, to make it closer to daily life using. Besides, we are going to record the things we have done to the process journal.</p>

                <p>In this week, we did our presentation for assessment 3. And we got some feedback from tutor and other classmates. Feedback includes we can add justification for the choice of design and some recommendation about the user interface. For this assessment, we are a bit beyond because we already did the high-fidelity prototype, so we decided to test it with users in this week. The work distribution is each of the group members need to do two user tests by using interview. </p>
                <p>Two participants</p>
                <p>1. Edmond</p>
                <p>Edmond said he is not confused at all, and understand all the part of the app. He thinks the app looks promising for a drone delivery service. The highlight is the logo, he feels like it is minimal and ease of use. He also gave some suggestions like for the navigation section, we can add more emphasis on parts that would be used more often and the style of the textbox could be changed.
                </p>
                <p>1. Allen</P>
                <p>Allen understand the app properly, and not confused at all. But for the font size, some of them are too big and looks not nice, and he want separate page estimated arrival time.
